created by [Siyi Li](http://lisiyi.me) and [Dit-Yan Yeung](http://home.cse.ust.hk/~dyyeung) at HKUST.

### Introduction
Drone Tracking Benchmark (DTB50) is a unified tracking benchmark on the drone platform. 
In this benchmark, we provide an extensive study of the state-of-the-art trackers and their various motion model variants on the DTB70 dataset.
Detailed description of the benchmark can be found in our [paper](http://lisiyi.me/paper/AAAI17_UAV.pdf).
